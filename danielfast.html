      <p>I have to think very hard in other to find something that I like about my job. It is a long and complicated story. 
      I have been with them since 2001. For the past twelve months, I have been praying a lot for some kind of change. 
      Last October, I was talking about it with one of nieces. We sometimes share inspirational video and text messages on WhatsApp. 
      That day she mentioned a book titled <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fscb3oKRL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="lien">The Circle Maker</a> 
      by Mike Batterson, 
      pastor of the Universal Church based in Washington DC. 
      The author:"shares powerful insights from the true legend of Honi the Circle Maker, a first-century Jewish sage whose bold prayer ended
      a drought and saved a generation".</p>
     <p>I bought the Kindle version of the book on Amazon.  In chapter 14, page 163, there is a section titled "Daniel Fast" 
     in reference to the Bible verse: "I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I
     used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over" (Daniel 10:3). I fasted for ten days.
     Did it work spiritually? Nope. But it was a wonder to my body. It was unlightened. Unfortunately, 
     it ended on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I had to cook for family members. It was very difficult not to 
     eat all those foods. However, I did a lighter version for the first three weeks of December. It was stunning. 
     I felt like my body was free of any toxin or impurity. Here is how I did it.</p></div>

     Not knowing exactly how to do the fast, I <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=daniel%20fast%20&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=daniel%20fast%20&sc=8-12&sk=&cvid=38D47EF4008F4954BBACB547A8D3FF61" class="lien">
     googled</a> it and found  plenty of books and info. The basic is avoiding certain foods and favor some others.<br>
     <p id="nb">Important: Try not to stay hungry all day long to avoid temptation.</p>
