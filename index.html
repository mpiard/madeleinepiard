      <h2 class ="titlecolor">How I started taking care of myself</h2>
      
      <p>The last years of my adolescence were quite troubling. I suffered from some sort of headache that stopped me from focusing, studying.
      There was always a heat feeling in my head. I saw the best doctors in my country. Nothing wrong was found in
      electroencephalograms and other brain tests. I got a break when someone suggested that I worked out regularly
      and mainly to put my head upside down with my body against a wall. I would wake up in the morning and practiced aerobics 
      on TV before going to school.</p>
     <p>This whole chapter took a toll on me. At 4 feet 11 inches and around 90 pounds, I was tiny, picky in everything,
     including food. One day, I realized I was killing myself and decided to feed myself properly.
     By that time, I used to earn my own money tutoring young kids.  I had the means to buy myself whatever foods
     I wanted.</p>
     <p>After high school and a secretarial certificate, I got a job, continued to follow closely my nutrition
     and intermittently paying a gym membership.</p>
     <p>Moving to the States did not stop me from monitoring my physical wellbeing. However, life is different here. 
     Foods are different. They are more available not necessary healthier which makes it more difficult to evaluate. 
     Moreover, with the passing years, my body has been less receptible, and my fat genes have been prevailing. 
     As a result, in other to stay fit and healthy, I have to pay more attention to my daily eating habits,  
     my daily physical activities  and daily lifestyle habits in general. I keep them simple and it is working</p>.

    <h2 class ="titlecolor">Basics to Healthy Eating</h2>
      
      <p>My first approach to healthy eating is planning ahead: Not only have at hand the basics for 
      any meal from fruits to vegetables, to whole grains, to roots, to spices, 
      to supplements powder such as collagen but also owning the necessary cooking utensils, 
      small appliances, food storage containers preferably glasses. Planning saves time and 
      money and keeps unhealthy foods away.</p>
      
     <p id="nb">The list might look excessive and foolish. It is neither one.<br> This is a life investment similar to any 
     investment, to the same level as buying cars, clothes, and houses.<br> Eating poorly destroy the body 
     and makes it impossible to enjoy anything in life.</p>

            A steamer</a> is very practical. Vegetables, whites and sweet potatoes, roots such as yucca, 
            yam, to name it can be steamed without over-cooking or any extra-added unhealthy ingredients or species. 
            I own a Uniware one. I got it since 2004. It is very strong and spacious. Unfortunately, it's not available
            on the market anymore.</li>

           Sizes of Pans And Pots </a></strong> makes it easy to stick to 
           specific routines. For example, the best way to get a hot herbal tea 
           first thing in the morning is assigning a pot to that use and having the tea 
           ready on the stove and rewarm it.
           The best way get mines is shopping around discount stores.
