    <p>I remember once I took one week off from my job to eat mostly soup and work out in order to lose weight and buy a skinny 
    pink suit that I liked a lot. I shed the weight and buy the size 4 suit. It was gorgeous. Before moving it, I had to part 
    way with my trophy suit because I got the pounds back.</p>
   <p>We surely play around with our weigh. During the holidays, we party, drink and eat more than we usually do and 
   add going to the gym on the top of our New Year resolutions list. I stop adding going to the gym on any of my lists.
   Paying for a gym membership is a waste of money.   Usually, we do not have time to go.</p>
   
   <p>Through the years, I have collected 
   small handy accessories that fit to any living space. Aside from walking and occasional jogging, I mostly exercise at
   home using the folliwing items:</p>

            fitness Tracker</a><br>
            In April 2017, one of my sisters was visiting from my country. She asked me to use my credit card 
            and get her a fitness tracker. Her blood pressure and sugar level were high.  Her doctor said she needed to
            exercise and using a fitness tracker would motivate her.  At one hundred forty nine dollars plus tax apiece, 
            I also bought one for me and had six months to pay off the balance. It was a very good investment. 
             Without even realized it, our daily activities such walking to the train to work, moving within the office space, 
           go grocery shopping and doing chores around the house are sometimes not enough to complete the necessary daily activity
           guideline to stay healthy. With a fitness tracker, the guideline is monitored. At the end of the day, it is always possible to go 
          around a block a few times to reach the 10,000 steps, or do a few sit-ups or take the stairs to burn extra calories.
